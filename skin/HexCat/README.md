## Installation ##

To install the GTK theme simply copy the *etc* folder into your HexChat installation. On Windows this folder actually doesn't exist so instead you will have to copy its contents to *share/themes/MS-Winodws/* in your root HexChat installation folder and overwrite anything there. I suggest making a copy *gtkrc* before copying though. For the color scheme you will have to copy the contents of the config folder to *%APPDATA%\HexChat* (Windows) or *~/.config/hexchat* (Unix). If you are running the portable version you will have to copy the files to the root HexChat folder instead.

Keep in mind for the colored nick names to take effect you will have to go into HexChat's Preferences and navigate to *Interface > Appearance*. There you will find an option to enable colored nick names. I have also included my custom background as can be seen in the screenshot. If you want to use it you can select the background image in the same settings menu.

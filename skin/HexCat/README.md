## Installation ##

To install the GTK theme simply copy the *etc* folder to your HexChat
installation. On Windows this folder actually doesn't exist by default so you
will have to create the folder and copy the contents in the new directory
withing in your root HexChat installation folder and overwrite anything there.
For the color scheme you will have to copy the contents of the configuration
folder to *%APPDATA%\HexChat* (Windows) or *~/.config/hexchat* (Unix). If you
are not running the portable version you will have to copy the files to the root
HexChat folder instead.

Keep in mind for the colored nick names to take effect you will have to go into
HexChats Preferences and navigate to *Interface > Appearance*. There you will
find an option to enable colored nick names. I have also included my custom
background as can be seen in the screenshot. If you want to use it you can
select the background image in the same settings menu.

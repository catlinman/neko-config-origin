## Installation ##

To install the GTK configuration in HexChat simply copy the *etc* folder into your HexChat installation. To apply the chat colors all you will have to do is to copy the config folder into the same root folder if you are using the portable installation. If not, you will find the configuration folder under *%APPDATA%\HexChat* (Windows) or *~/.config/hexchat* (Unix).

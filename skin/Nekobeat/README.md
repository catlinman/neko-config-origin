## Installation ##

To install Nekobeat simply drag and drop the Nekobeat folder into your root Osu!/Skins folder. From there on you will be able to select the skin from the ingame settings menu. If you wish you can also pack it as a *.osk* file. This is however only required if you intend to redistribute the skin.

This folder contains little scripts and projects I wrote in an average of 15 minutes. Some things are cool, others are disappointing. You won't find anything of high quality and use here, in fact you might find some of the worst code I have ever written. This is all due to reasons like me just not feeling like writing good code in a given minute on a given day. With all that said: You have been warned. Don't take any of this as a point of reference for any of my work.

Feel free to however take anything from here and mess with it. Do whatever you want with it really. Want to release my poop? Go ahead.

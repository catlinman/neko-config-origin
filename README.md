# Nekoconfig #

Nekoconfig is a semi important repository containing most of my public configuration files as well as application skins and syntax highlighting settings for different kinds of code editing environments.

The repository is split into two main folders. One contains skins and syntax highlighting sheets I've made while the other contains most of my config files for various applications.

A list of all the programs covered in some way can be seen below.

- Configuration
	- Rainmeter layout configuration file
	- Both Unix Vim (.vimrc) and Windows gVim (_vimrc) configuration files
	- i3 window manager configuration files
- Skins and Themes
	- Subneko Sublime theme
	- Vineko Vim color scheme
	- Nekobeat Osu skin
	- Hivecom Teamspeak skin

For a full listing as well as further information please take a look at the README.md files in the given subfolders.

## License ##

There is no license. Feel free to scrap together something nice without my permission. What I do require though is that if you use the configuration files and or skins/themes in some way that I am still credited if you intend to redistribute them.

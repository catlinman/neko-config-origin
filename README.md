# Nekoconfig #

Nekoconfig is a semi important repository containing most of my public configuration files as well as application skins and syntax highlighting settings for different kinds of code editing environments.

The repository is split into two main folders. One contains skins and syntax highlighting sheets I've made while the other contains most of my config files for various applications.

There is no license. Feel free to scrap together something nice without my permission. Please don't destroy the world with whatever you use these config files in. That's all.
